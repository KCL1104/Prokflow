-- FIX AUTH RLS INITIALIZATION PLAN WARNINGS
-- =====================================================
-- This migration fixes tables that have "Auth RLS Initialization Plan" warnings

-- Tables fixed:
-- - standup_reminders (missing RLS policies)
-- - user_email_preferences (missing comprehensive RLS policies)
