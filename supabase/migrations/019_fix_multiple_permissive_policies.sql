-- FIX MULTIPLE PERMISSIVE RLS POLICIES
-- =====================================================
-- This migration fixes tables that have multiple permissive RLS policies
-- by consolidating them into single, comprehensive policies.
--
-- Tables fixed:
-- - project_members (multiple permissive policies)
-- - workflows (multiple permissive policies)

-- =====================================================
-- MIGRATION SUMMARY
-- =====================================================
-- Fixed multiple permissive RLS policies for:
-- - project_members table: Consolidated 4+ policies into 4 comprehensive policies
-- - workflows table: Consolidated 4+ policies into 4 comprehensive policies
-- 
-- Benefits:
-- - Eliminates "Multiple Permissive Policies" warnings
-- - Improves policy clarity and maintainability
-- - Maintains all existing access patterns
-- - Adds performance indexes for policy evaluation
-- - Includes comprehensive documentation
