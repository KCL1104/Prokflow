-- =====================================================
-- RLS POLICY OPTIMIZATION MIGRATION
-- =====================================================
-- This migration optimizes Row Level Security policies to improve performance
-- by reducing repeated auth.uid() evaluations and using cached helper functions.
--
-- Performance Benefits:
-- - Reduces auth.uid() calls from O(n) to O(1) per query
-- - Improves query performance for large datasets
-- - Maintains same security guarantees as original policies
