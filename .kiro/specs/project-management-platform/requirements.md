#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL provide options to select from Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, or Custom methodology
2. WHEN a methodology is selected THEN the system SHALL configure default workflow states and features appropriate to that methodology
3. WHEN Custom methodology is selected THEN the system SHALL allow users to define their own workflow states and transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to manage tasks and user stories in a product backlog, so that we can prioritize and plan our work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the product backlog THEN the system SHALL display all tasks and user stories in priority order
2. WHEN a user creates a new backlog item THEN the system SHALL allow setting priority, story points, description, and acceptance criteria
3. WHEN a user reorders backlog items THEN the system SHALL update the priority automatically
4. WHEN a backlog item is moved to a sprint THEN the system SHALL remove it from the product backlog view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a scrum master, I want to create and manage sprints, so that the team can work in focused iterations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a sprint THEN the system SHALL allow setting sprint name, duration, start date, and end date
2. WHEN a sprint is active THEN the system SHALL display sprint progress and remaining capacity
3. WHEN a sprint ends THEN the system SHALL automatically move incomplete items back to the product backlog
4. WHEN viewing sprint details THEN the system SHALL show burndown charts and velocity metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to view and update tasks on a Kanban board, so that I can track work progress visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the board view THEN the system SHALL display tasks organized by workflow states
2. WHEN a user drags a task between columns THEN the system SHALL update the task status automatically
3. WHEN WIP limits are configured THEN the system SHALL prevent adding more tasks than the limit allows
4. WHEN a task is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in real-time for all team members

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to view Gantt charts and timeline views, so that I can track project schedules and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Gantt view THEN the system SHALL display tasks with start dates, end dates, and dependencies
2. WHEN a task dependency is created THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust dependent task dates if needed
3. WHEN viewing the critical path THEN the system SHALL highlight tasks that affect the project end date
4. WHEN milestones are set THEN the system SHALL display them prominently on the timeline

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to track resource allocation and team capacity, so that I can balance workload effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to customize workflow states and transitions, so that the platform can adapt to our specific processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN defining transitions THEN the system SHALL allow specifying which states can transition to which other states
3. WHEN workflow rules are set THEN the system SHALL enforce them during task status updates
4. WHEN workflows are modified THEN the system SHALL migrate existing tasks to compatible states

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want to view progress reports and analytics, so that I can understand project health and team performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide burndown charts, velocity trends, and completion rates
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show cycle time, lead time, and throughput metrics
3. WHEN accessing dashboards THEN the system SHALL display real-time project status and key performance indicators
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support common formats like PDF, CSV, and Excel
